Simple path finding game with pygame. One of my first projects

The game creates a grid with checkpoints and the "snake" will start in the bottom right corner and get to all the checkpoints then to the finish.

You can draw by holding left mouse button and create a "maze" before you press the green button to begin.

The game will tell you the path length and also start walking through the shortest path.
